# Anchor Lines Progress

### M0 — Scaffold
- [x] `create-next-app` (TS, Tailwind, App Router), scripts for `typecheck`,
      `lint`, `test` (vitest), `eval`. README with 3-line setup.
- [x] `lib/schema.ts` exactly as §6, with zod validators + 3 unit tests.
- **Done when:** fresh clone → `npm i && npm run dev` renders landing page;
  all checks green.

### M1 — Synthetic fixtures
- [x] Generate 3 synthetic award letters as HTML → render to PNG (script in
      `eval/make-fixtures.ts`). Vary terminology deliberately: one says
      "Direct Unsub", one "Unsubsidized Stafford Loan DL", one omits COA.
      Fake names/schools only.
- [x] Hand-write expected JSON for each into `eval/letters/`.
- **Done when:** 3 image+JSON pairs exist; images look like plausible letters.

### M2 — Transcription + extraction API
- [x] `lib/llm.ts`: image(s) in → (pass 1) full transcription → (pass 2)
      extraction with `source_quote`s, validated against zod schema; one
      retry on validation failure, then 422.
- [x] `app/api/extract/route.ts` wiring; deployable 4 MiB upload cap;
      PNG/JPG/PDF input; same-origin, per-IP, and in-process concurrency guards.
- **Done when:** `curl` with fixture #1 returns valid `LetterAnalysis`.

### M3 — Anchor matcher
- [x] `lib/anchor.ts`: normalize (lowercase, collapse whitespace, strip
      punctuation) → exact substring → sliding-window Levenshtein fallback
      (threshold ≥0.85 similarity). Returns char offsets into transcription
      or `null`.
- [x] Unit tests: exact, OCR-noise ("$5,5OO"), reordered, absent.
- **Done when:** tests pass; fixture claims anchor at ≥90%.

### M4 — Eval harness
- [x] `eval/run-eval.ts`: independently reads checked-in candidate extraction
      snapshots and expected JSON, then reports field accuracy and expected-anchor
      verification. Prints a table, writes `eval/last-run.json`, and exits
      non-zero if aggregate field accuracy or anchor verification is <85%, or
      if there are no expected anchors. Candidate quotes must equal immutable
      expected quotes and anchor in both expected and candidate transcriptions;
      omissions and extras are penalized.
- **Done when:** `npm run eval` prints a real table on all fixtures.

### M5 — Anchored letter view (the demo centerpiece)
- [x] Split-pane: left = transcription (original image toggle), right =
      plain-language cards grouped gift aid / loans / work-study / costs.
- [x] Hover/tap a card → source span highlights + scrolls into view. Unmatched
      → amber "not stated in letter" badge.
- [x] Every dollar figure card shows the pack's plain-English explanation and
      stated period; four-year loan projections appear only for defensibly
      annualized year/semester amounts.
- **Done when:** upload fixture → interact end-to-end; mobile-usable.

### M6 — Compare view + warnings
- [x] Table across 2+ letters: COA, gift aid, loans, net price (COA − gift
      aid), projected 4-yr debt. Missing COA → red "cost hidden" cell; semester
      COA is annualized ×2, while total or unknown cost/aid periods → a visible
      not-comparable state.
- [x] Pack warnings: work-study ≠ bill reduction; loans grouped with grants;
      Parent PLUS flagged as parent debt.
- **Done when:** fixtures #1+#3 produce an honest comparison including the
  hidden-cost flag.

### M7 — Polish + deploy readiness
- [x] Landing: one-line pitch, "try sample letters" button, privacy note
      (uploads go to Anthropic; Anchor Lines does not persist bytes; analysis and
      transcription remain in tab `sessionStorage`; samples are local/key-free).
- [x] Loading/error states; graceful handling of a non-letter image
      ("This doesn't look like an award letter").
- [x] `vercel.json` if needed; document env vars in README. No `vercel.json`
      was added because the default Vercel Next.js App Router handling supports
      the server route without a custom rewrite or runtime override.
- **Done when:** demo flows sample→analysis→compare with zero uploads.

### M8 — Devpost kit assets (drafts; humans finalize)
- [x] `submission/WRITEUP.md`: problem (with the stats in §1), solution,
      how anchoring works, eval numbers from `eval/last-run.json`, tech list.
- [x] `submission/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`: 3-minute beat-by-beat video script ending
      on the "not stated in letter" badge + eval number.
- **Done when:** both drafts exist and cite the real measured anchor rate.

## Deviations

- 2026-07-18: Replaced create-next-app's Google-hosted Geist loader with system fonts so builds do not require network access.
- 2026-07-19: documented deviation: no `vercel.json` was added because the
  default Vercel configuration is compatible with this Next.js App Router
  application and its server route.
- 2026-07-19: documented deviation: no live Anthropic network test was run
  without a secret. Sample mode is the zero-key verified path; live extraction
  requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- 2026-07-19: documented deviation: the planned 10 MiB upload conflicts with
  Vercel Functions' 4.5 MB request-body limit. The implemented maximum is 4 MiB
  for PNG, JPG, and PDF so multipart overhead remains below the platform limit;
  Blob persistence was intentionally not introduced.
- 2026-07-19: documented deviation: abuse controls are best-effort and
  serverless-compatible. Same-origin checks are deterministic, while the
  five-per-IP/minute limit and two-call concurrency cap are in-memory per
  process, not distributed/global, and reset with instance lifecycle.

## Session notes

2026-07-18 - Completed M0 scaffold with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vitest scripts, and a 3-line setup README.
Checks passed: typecheck, lint, test, eval, production build; dev landing page returned HTTP 200.
npm install reported 2 moderate transitive vulnerabilities; no breaking audit fix was applied.
2026-07-18 - Added the exact `LetterAnalysis` and `LineItem` contract with strict Zod validators and three unit tests.
Checks passed: typecheck, lint, test.
2026-07-18 - Completed M1, M3, and M4 with three rendered synthetic-only award letters, deterministic expected analyses, index-mapped source anchors, and the evaluation harness.
Checks passed: make-fixtures, targeted tests, typecheck, lint, and test. The
original self-comparison eval result from this session was invalid and is
superseded by the separate candidate-vs-expected evaluation below.
2026-07-18 - Completed M2 with two-pass Anthropic transcription/extraction, one schema-feedback retry, upload validation, and API-key-free synthetic sample responses.
Checks passed: targeted extraction/API tests, typecheck, lint, and test.
2026-07-18 - Completed M5, M6, and the user-facing landing/loading portions of M7 with a typed session analysis store, responsive anchored letter workspace, honest multi-offer comparison, and accessible upload/sample states.
Checks passed: targeted RED/GREEN tests (10/10), typecheck, lint, full tests (48/48), production build, and HTTP smoke for landing/sample API/letter/compare routes.
2026-07-19 - Completed M7 deployment documentation and M8 draft submission assets. README now documents setup, commands, supported input, synthetic sample mode, architecture, environment variables, Vercel deployment, privacy, and not-financial-advice limits.
Acceptance evidence: release-documentation test, typecheck, lint, full tests, eval, and production build were run in this session. Sample mode is the zero-key verified path; live Anthropic extraction requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and was not network-tested without it. Human-owned deployment, registration, real-letter collection, video recording, and final submission remain in `HUMAN_TODO.md`.
2026-07-19 - Final review fix wave hardened semantic source binding, deterministic
classification/explanations, monetary multiset coverage, conservative periods,
Anthropic completion handling, non-letter detection, the deployable upload
contract, serverless abuse controls, period-aware comparison math, and honest
independent fixture evaluation. The checked-in synthetic candidate comparison
measures 83/91 fields (91.2%) and 11/12 expected anchors (91.7%); the intentional
Cedar omission counts as a failure and both 85% aggregate gates pass.
Controller interactive browser smoke: Cedar sample loaded; activating Direct
Unsub marked the exact source text; Original rendered the letter image; Juniper
loaded; Compare showed the red cost hidden state; and the 390×844 mobile check
had no document overflow. Live Anthropic and Vercel deployment remain untested
without credentials/deployment authority; video and submission remain human-owned.

2026-08-07 - Removed OCR entirely and narrowed input to formats whose text is
recoverable exactly. Uploads are now plain text only: images and PDFs are
rejected at both the client and the route, because OCR is approximate and PDF
text extraction reconstructs word spacing from glyph kerning and reading order
from page geometry, which is least reliable on the dollar-bearing tables this
tool reads. The transcription pass is gone — a `.txt` upload already is the
transcription — so extraction is a single Anthropic call. `lib/anchor.ts` lost
its sliding-window Levenshtein fallback and now requires an exact match after
case/whitespace normalization; a quote absent from the letter is treated as a
fabrication rather than a misreading, and the per-claim "Source match · N%"
badge was replaced with "Found in letter" since the score was always 1 by
construction. Signature-byte validation was replaced with strict UTF-8 decoding
plus a control-character sweep, which is the equivalent guarantee for text. The
upload cap moved from 4 MiB to 32 KiB: it is now an output-token budget, since
the model echoes the transcription back inside its JSON response. Suite is
210 tests green (was 201).
